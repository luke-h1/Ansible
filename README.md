<hr>


### Project Structure: 
  * This projects contains sub-directories for Mac & Linux. Each directory generally consists of a playbook and a bash script for that given OS. Note: These playbooks & bash scripts are very opinionated and if you intend to run these on your machine it is very advisable to edit to your own needs / preference. 

  * Each directory contains instructions on how to get up and running with Ansible.
