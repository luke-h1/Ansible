## NOTES : 
run the mac-catalina.sh script first as this will install homebrew and node which if left uninstalled will cause the ansible-playbook to fail. The shell script is highly opiniated with regards to the options that are setup so it is worth it to fork this repo & edit the shell script to your own needs
