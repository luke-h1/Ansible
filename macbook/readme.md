## NOTES : 
* run the mac-catalina.sh script first as this will install homebrew, Ansible & Node which if left uninstalled will cause the playbook to fail. 

* The shell script is highly opiniated with regards to the options that are setup so it is worth it to clone this repo & edit the shell script locally to your own needs 


### things that cannot be automated 
  * stealth-mode. Allows the mac to not respond to pings or nmap queries 
  * balena etcher 
  * tor browser  
  * intel power gadget 
  * VS code extensions (https://github.com/luke-h1/vscode-settings/blob/master/README.MD)
  * browserstack
